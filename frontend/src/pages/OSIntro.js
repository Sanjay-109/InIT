    <h2>27. What are overlays?</h2>
    <p>
        The concept of overlays is that whenever a process is running it will not use the complete program at the same time, it will use only some part of it. Then overlay concept says that whatever part you required, you load it and once the part is done, then you just unload it, which means just pull it back and get the new part you required and run it. Formally, “The process of transferring a block of program code or other data into internal memory, replacing what is already stored”.

    <h2>28. What is the basic function of paging?</h2>
    <p>
        Paging is a method or technique which is used for non-contiguous memory allocation. It is a fixed-size partitioning theme (scheme). In paging, both main memory and secondary memory are divided into equal fixed-size partitions. The partitions of the secondary memory area unit and the main memory area unit are known as pages and frames respectively.

      Paging is a memory management method accustomed fetch processes from the secondary memory into the main memory in the form of pages. in paging, each process is split into parts wherever the size of every part is the same as the page size. The size of the last half could also be but the page size. The pages of the process area unit hold on within the frames of main memory relying upon their accessibility

            <li>Named Pipes (Different Processes): This is a pipe with a specific name it can be used in processes that don’t have a shared common process origin. E.g. FIFO where the details written to a pipe are first named.</li>
            <li>Message Queuing: This allows messages to be passed between processes using either a single queue or several message queues. This is managed by the system kernel and these messages are coordinated using an API.</li>
            <li>Semaphores: This is used in solving problems associated with synchronization and avoiding race conditions. These are integer values that are greater than or equal to 0.</li>
            <li>Shared Memory: This allows the interchange of data through a defined area of memory. Semaphore values have to be obtained before data can get access to shared memory.</li>
            <li>Sockets: This method is mostly used to communicate over a network between a client and a server. It allows for a standard connection which is computer and OS independent.</li>

        The resource allocation graph is explained to us what is the state of the system in terms of processes and resources. One of the advantages of having a diagram is, sometimes it is possible to see a deadlock directly by using RAG.

    <h2>56. What is a deadlock?</h2>
        <p>
            Deadlock is a situation in which two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources, resulting in a standstill where no progress can be made.

    <h2>57. What is the goal and functionality of memory management?</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of memory management is to maximize memory utilization through tasks like relocation, protection, sharing, and organization in terms of logical and physical memory.

    <h2>58. What are the differences between Multiprogramming, Multitasking, and Multiprocessing?</h2>
    <p>Multiprogramming refers to the execution of multiple programs on a single processor, where only one program is executed at a time but others are kept in memory. Multitasking involves the execution of multiple tasks (such as processes or threads) concurrently on a single processor. Multiprocessing, on the other hand, involves the use of multiple processors to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>

    <h2>59. Explain the concept of File Systems. What are the different types of File Systems?</h2>
    <p>A file system is a method used by an operating system to store, retrieve, and organize files on a storage medium. Common types of file systems include FAT (File Allocation Table), NTFS (New Technology File System), ext4 (Fourth Extended File System), and HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus).</p>

    <h2>60. What are the differences between Multiprogramming, Multitasking, and Multiprocessing?</h2>
    <p>Multiprogramming refers to the ability of an operating system to execute multiple programs concurrently by keeping several programs in memory at the same time. Multitasking is the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks (or processes) concurrently, allowing users to perform multiple activities simultaneously. Multiprocessing involves the use of multiple processors (or cores) in a single computer system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, thus increasing overall system performance.</p>
