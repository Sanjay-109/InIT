        <h2>1. What are the advantages of DBMS over traditional file-based systems? </h2>
        <p>
            Database management systems were developed to handle the following difficulties of typical File-processing systems supported by conventional operating systems. 
        1. Data redundancy and inconsistency 
        2. Difficulty in accessing data 
        3. Data isolation – multiple files and formats 
        4. Integrity problems 
        5. Atomicity of updates 
        6. Concurrent access by multiple users 
        7. Security problems

        <h2>2. What are super, primary, candidate, and foreign keys? </h2>
        <p>
            A super key is a set of attributes of a relation schema upon which all attributes of the schema are functionally dependent. No two rows can have the same value of super key attributes. 
           A Candidate key is a minimal superkey, i.e., no proper subset of Candidate key attributes can be a superkey. 
         A Primary Key is one of the candidate keys. One of the candidate keys is selected as most important and becomes the primary key. There cannot be more than one primary key in a table..
        A Foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. 

        </p>

        <h2>3. What is the difference between primary key and unique constraints? </h2>
        <p>
            The primary key cannot have NULL value, the unique constraints can have NULL values. There is only one primary key in a table, but there can be multiple unique constrains. 
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>4. What is database normalization? </h2>
        <p>
            It is a process of analyzing the given relation schemas based on their functional dependencies and primary keys to achieve the following desirable properties: 
            1. Minimizing Redundancy 
            2. Minimizing the Insertion, Deletion, And Update Anomalies Relation schemas that do not meet the properties are decomposed into smaller relation schemas that could meet desirable properties.

        <h2>5. Why is the use of DBMS recommended? Explain by listing some of its major advantages?</h2>
        <p>
            Some of the major advantages of DBMS are as follows:

            Controlled Redundancy: DBMS supports a mechanism to control the redundancy of data inside the database by integrating all the data into a single database and as data is stored in only one place, the duplicity of data does not happen.
            Data Sharing: Sharing of data among multiple users simultaneously can also be done in DBMS as the same database will be shared among all the users and by different application programs.
            Backup and Recovery Facility: DBMS minimizes the pain of creating the backup of data again and again by providing a feature of ‘backup and recovery’ which automatically creates the data backup and restores the data whenever required.
            Enforcement of Integrity Constraints: Integrity Constraints are very important to be enforced on the data so that the refined data after putting some constraints are stored in the database and this is followed by DBMS.
            Independence of Data: It simply means that you can change the structure of the data without affecting the structure of any of the application programs.

        <h2>8. Explain the various types of keys in a database.</h2>
        <p>
            In a database, there are several types of keys: 
            <ul>
                <li>Candidate Key: Uniquely identifies a tuple</li>
                <li>Primary Key: Chosen candidate key serving as the main identifier</li>
                <li>Foreign Key: Links attributes between tables</li>
                <li>Unique Key: Ensures uniqueness, allows null values</li>

        <h2>9. Compare the DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in a DBMS.</h2>
        <p>
            The DELETE command is used to remove specific rows from a table based on conditions specified in the WHERE clause. In contrast, the TRUNCATE command is used to delete all data from a table without conditions.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>10. What are the limitations of traditional file-based systems that make DBMS a preferable choice?</h2>
        <p>Traditional file-based systems lack indexing, leading to time-consuming content retrieval. Redundancy and inconsistency arise due to duplicate data, and updating one file causes inconsistency across all duplicates. Disorganized data makes it difficult to access information. Furthermore, unlike DBMS, traditional systems lack concurrency management, which allows simultaneous operations. DBMS addresses integrity checks, data isolation, atomicity, and security issues.</p>

        <h2>11. How do entities differ from attributes in a database?</h2>
        <p>
            In a database, an entity represents a real-world object, such as an employee, department, or designation. On the other hand, an attribute describes a specific characteristic or property of an entity. For example, an employee entity may have attributes like name, ID, and age, which provide additional information about the entity.

    <section>
        <h2>12. What types of interactions can be handled by a DBMS?</h2>
        <p>
            A DBMS can handle various interactions, including data definition (creating and modifying the structure of databases and tables), update (adding, modifying, or deleting data), retrieval (retrieving specific data from databases), and administration (managing user permissions, security, backups, etc.).

        <h2>13. Explain query optimization in DBMS.</h2>
        <p>
            Query optimization is the process of identifying the most efficient plan for evaluating a query, minimizing the estimated cost. It involves selecting the best algorithms and approaches among multiple options to achieve the desired outcome. Query optimization aims to deliver query results faster, handle a larger number of queries in less time, and reduce the complexity of time and space requirements.

        <h2>14.  Are NULL values equivalent to zero or blank space?</h2>
        <p>
            No, NULL values are distinct from zero or blank space. While zero represents a numerical value and blank space represents a character, NULL denotes a value that is unavailable, unknown, assigned, or not applicable.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>15. Define aggregation and atomicity.</h2>
        <p>
            Aggregation is a feature in the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model that allows one relationship set to interact with another relationship set.

            Atomicity is a property that specifies a database alteration must adhere to all rules or none at all. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction fails.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>16.  What are the different levels of abstraction in DBMS?</h2>
        <p>
            DBMS operates at three levels of data abstraction:

            Physical Level: This is the lowest level of abstraction that defines how data is stored in the database system.
            Logical Level: After the physical level, the logical level defines what data is stored in the database and how the data pieces relate to each other.
            View Level: The highest level of abstraction, the view level, describes a specific portion of the entire database, focusing on a user's perspective or requirements.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>17. How would you define an entity-relationship model?</h2>
        <p>
            An entity-relationship model is a graphical approach to database design where real-world objects are represented as entities, and the relationships between them are depicted. It provides a visual representation that allows the database administrators (DBAs) to quickly understand the schema.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>18. Explain the terms Entity, Entity Type, and Entity Set in DBMS.</h2>
        <p>
            Entity: An entity refers to a real-world object with attributes that represent its characteristics. For example, an employee is an entity with attributes like empid and empname.
            Entity Type: An entity type is a collection of entities that share the same attributes. It represents one or more related tables in a database. For instance, an employee type can have attributes such as empid, empname, and department.
            Entity Set: In a database, an entity set is a collection of all entities of a specific entity type. It represents a group of related entities, such as a set of employees, companies, or persons.

        <h2>19. What is meant by a transparent DBMS?</h2>
        <p>
            A transparent DBMS is a type of database management system that hides its physical structure from users. The physical structure, including the memory manager and how data is stored on disk, is concealed from users. This abstraction allows users to focus on the logical representation of the data without worrying about the internal storage details.

        <h2>20. What are the unary operations in Relational Algebra?</h2>
        <p>
            In relational algebra, unary operations are operations that work on a single operand. The two common unary operations are PROJECTION and SELECTION. These operations manipulate and retrieve data from a single relation. Additionally, RENAME is another unary operation used to rename attributes or relations in a relational algebra expression.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>21. What are the different data models?</h2>
        <p>
            There are several different data models, including:

            <li>Hierarchical data model</li> 
            <li>Network model</li> 
            <li>Relational model</li>

        <h2>22. Explain Relation Schema and Relation</h2>
        <p>
            A Relation Schema, also known as a table schema, defines the properties and structure of a relation or table. It specifies the name of the table and provides a blueprint for organizing data into tables. The relation schema does not contain any actual data.

            A Relation represents a table in a relational database. It is a collection of tuples (rows) where each tuple consists of an ordered list of values. The attributes in the relation are the connected columns, and key attributes uniquely identify the tuples. In mathematical terms, a relation is a set of tuples (t1, t2, t3, ..., tn) where each tuple contains an ordered list of n values (t=1) (v1, v2, ..., vn).
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>23. What is the Degree of relation?</h2>
        <p>
            The degree of a relation is one of the attributes of its relation schema. It refers to the number of attributes (columns) in the relation. The degree, also known as Cardinality, describes how many times one entity occurs in relation to another entity. There are three degrees of relation: one-to-one (1:1), one-to-many (1:M), and many-to-one (M:1).
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>24. Define Relationship in a database context.</h2>
        <p>
            A relationship in a database refers to an association between two or more entities. It represents the way entities are related to each other. There are three types of relationships commonly used in database management systems:

            One-to-One: A single record of one entity can be linked to a single record of another entity.
            One-to-Many (Many-to-One): A single record of one entity can be linked to multiple records of another entity, and vice versa.
            Many-to-Many: Multiple records of one entity can be linked to multiple records of another entity.

        <h2>26. Explain the concept of data integrity in a database.</h2>
        <p>Data integrity ensures the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data in a database. It is maintained through various constraints like primary key, foreign key, unique key, and check constraints. By enforcing data integrity rules, databases prevent invalid data from being entered, maintain consistency, and enhance the quality of data stored.</p>

        <h2>27. Define a view in SQL.  </h2>
        <p>In SQL, a view is a virtual table created from the result set of a SQL statement. It allows users to query the view as if it were a regular table, providing a simplified and customized representation of the data in the underlying tables.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>28. What are the uses of views? </h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Data Subset: Views can represent a subset of data from one or more tables, limiting the exposure of underlying tables to users and allowing them to query specific portions of the data.</li>
                <li>Simplification: Views can combine and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table, making complex data structures more manageable and easier to work with.</li>
                <li>Aggregation: Views can be used as aggregated tables, where the database engine performs aggregate functions (e.g., sum, average) and displays the results alongside the data.</li>
                <li>Data Complexity Hiding: Views can hide the complexity of underlying tables by providing a simplified and user-friendly representation of the data.</li>
                <li>Minimal Storage: Views occupy minimal storage space since they only store the definition of the view, not a copy of the entire data it displays.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Security: Depending on the SQL engine used, views can provide additional security by restricting access to specific columns or rows of the underlying tables.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>29. What is a Trigger?</h2>
        <p>A trigger is a piece of code associated with insert, update, or delete operations on a table. It automatically executes when the associated query is run, enforcing specific actions or constraints whenever data changes occur to maintain database integrity.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>30. What is a stored procedure?</h2>
        <p>A stored procedure is a collection of pre-defined operations grouped together in the database. It allows executing complex routines efficiently by encapsulating and reusing code logic within the database. Stored procedures can be called with specific parameters and enhance security and performance.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>31. How does a Trigger differ from a Stored Procedure?</h2>
        <p>Triggers are automatically invoked based on data manipulation events like insert, update, or delete operations, whereas stored procedures are explicitly called by applications or users for specific tasks, providing a modular way to execute sets of operations.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>32. Explain the concept of database normalization.</h2>
        <p>Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by decomposing tables into smaller, more manageable structures. It aims to minimize anomalies and ensure data integrity through functional dependencies and normalization forms.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>33. What are indexes in a database?</h2>
        <p>Indexes are data structures used to enhance search efficiency by facilitating quicker data retrieval operations on database tables. They organize and store data in a specific order, optimizing query performance based on specific values.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>34. Differentiate between clustered and non-clustered indexes.</h2>
        <p>Clustered indexes determine the physical order of data storage on the disk, whereas non-clustered indexes establish logical ordering without affecting the physical order of data. Each database table can have only one clustered index, while multiple non-clustered indexes can be created for a table.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>35. What is denormalization in a database?</h2>
        <p>Denormalization is a technique employed in database optimization where duplicate data is deliberately introduced into one or more tables to improve performance by reducing complex joins and enhancing data retrieval speed.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>36. What is a clause in SQL?</h2>
        <p>In SQL, a clause is a component of a query that allows filtering or customizing the data being queried. It specifies conditions or actions to be applied to the data.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>37. Define Livelock.</h2>
        <p>Livelock occurs when two or more processes engage in a futile interaction without making any progress. Processes are continuously executing without achieving the desired outcome, unlike a deadlock where processes are waiting.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>38. What is the purpose of SQL?</h2>
        <p>The primary purpose of SQL (Structured Query Language) is to interact with relational databases, enabling operations such as querying, updating, and modifying data in the database.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>39. Explain the concepts of a Primary Key and Foreign Key.</h2>
        <p>A Primary Key is a unique identifier for records in a database table, ensuring their uniqueness and serving as a reference point for data retrieval. A Foreign Key establishes a relationship between tables by referencing the Primary Key of another table.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>40. What are the main differences between a Primary Key and Unique Key?</h2>
        <p>The key differences between a Primary Key and Unique Key are:
            <ul>
                <li>A Primary Key cannot contain a null value, whereas a Unique Key can.</li>
                <li>Each table can have only one Primary Key, while multiple Unique Keys can exist in a table.</li>

    <section>
        <h2>42. How is the DROP command used, and what are the differences between DROP, TRUNCATE, and DELETE commands?</h2>
        <p>The DROP command is used in SQL to delete an existing table, database, index, or view. The main differences between DROP, TRUNCATE, and DELETE commands are:
            <ul>
                <li>DROP and TRUNCATE are DDL commands to delete tables and their indexes, while DELETE is a DML command to specific rows from a table.</li>
                <li>DROP removes the entire table structure, TRUNCATE deletes all rows but keeps the structure, DELETE allows for the operation to be rolled back.</li>
            </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>49. Explain the difference between a database and a database management system (DBMS).</h2>
        <p>A database is an organized collection of data, while a database management system (DBMS) is a software system that enables the storage, manipulation, and retrieval of data from a database. The DBMS provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the data, ensuring data security, integrity, and consistency.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>50.  Explain the distinction between intension and extension in a database.</h2>
        <p>
            In a database, intension refers to the database schema or design, which remains relatively unchanged. Extension, on the other hand, represents the actual data stored in the database at a specific point in time, fluctuating as tuples are created, updated, or deleted.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>51.  Compare the DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in a DBMS.</h2>
        <p>
            The DELETE command is used to remove specific rows from a table based on conditions specified in the WHERE clause. In contrast, the TRUNCATE command is used to delete all data from a table without conditions.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>52. What is a lock, and how does a shared lock differ from an exclusive lock during a transaction in a database?</h2>
        <p>
            A lock in a database prevents multiple users or sessions from updating the same data simultaneously. A shared lock allows multiple transactions to read data concurrently, while an exclusive lock ensures only one transaction can perform write operations to maintain data consistency.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>53. Describe the different normalization forms in a DBMS.</h2>
        <p>
            The primary normalization forms in a DBMS include:
            <li>1NF: Ensures atomicity of data and eliminates duplicate columns.</li>

        <h2>54. Differentiate between a 2-tier and 3-tier architecture in a DBMS</h2>
        <p>
            A 2-tier architecture involves direct interaction between client applications and the database server. In contrast, a 3-tier architecture adds an intermediary layer, providing a graphical user interface and enhanced security by separating the client-side application from the server-side application.

        <h2>55. Explain the distinction between logical database design and physical database design and how this separation leads to data independence.</h2>
        <p>
            Logical database design involves transforming the conceptual schema into a relational database structure, while physical database design focuses on storage, indexing, and optimization. This separation leads to data independence because the logical design is independent of the physical design, allowing changes to the physical implementation without affecting the logical representation.

        <h2>56. What are temporary tables and when are they beneficial?</h2>
        <p>
            Temporary tables are tables that are used for a single session or for the duration of a transaction. They are commonly used to support unique rollups or specific application processing needs. Unlike permanent tables, temporary tables do not have pre-allocated space and dynamically allocate space as rows are added. In Oracle, you can create temporary tables using the CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE command.

        <h2>57. Define database partitioning and its significance.</h2>
        <p>
            Database partitioning is the process of dividing a logical database into independent components to enhance availability, performance, and manageability. It allows for efficient access to specific partitions, enables data storage on low-cost storage devices, and improves query performance.

        <h2>58. How do you interact with an RDBMS?</h2>
        <p>
            To interact with an RDBMS, you use Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL queries are used to provide input to the database, and the database processes these queries to generate the desired output.

        <h2>59. Define specialization and generalization in the context of database design.</h2>
        <p>
            Specialization: The process of creating subclasses for a specific entity type. Each subclass inherits all attributes and relationships of the parent entity and may have additional unique attributes and relationships.

            Generalization: The process of identifying common attributes and relationships among a group of entities and defining a common superclass for them.

        <h2>60. What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP databases?</h2>
        <p>
            OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) databases are optimized for transactional processing, supporting day-to-day operations with a focus on fast and concurrent data modifications. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) databases, on the other hand, are designed for analytical processing and reporting, providing complex querying capabilities and aggregations for decision-making and data analysis purposes.
